/**
 * The 30 known-dirty `city_raw` strings from `data/bvd/` (§4.6: 25 ALL-CAPS
 * + 5 abbreviated prefixes), each paired with the real Census 2024
 * Gazetteer `name_normalized` value for that exact (state, city) —
 * `scripts/load_gazetteer.py`'s Place/County-Subdivision suffix-stripping
 * applied to the live 2024_Gaz_place_national / 2024_Gaz_cousubs_national
 * files, fetched from www2.census.gov and checked by hand against every
 * row below.
 *
 * This is the "shared fixture" BUILD-PLAN step 9.1 asks for: proof that
 * `normalizeCity()` converges on the same string
 * `scripts/load_gazetteer.py` would have already stored, for every dirty
 * string that exists in the real data — not just a plausible-looking
 * title-case.
