/**
 * T-31: `npm run import-invoice -- ./data/bvd-invoices/999210.csv` end to
 * end, then every figure checked against the database directly in SQL —
 * never against application code, so these prove the data, not the code
 * path that wrote it (BUILD-PLAN-v2.md Step 31.2).
 *
 * Migrations 0001-0006 (via `runMigrations`) seed the real 27-card/driver/
 * truck roster (0004, §A19), so every card and every present unit number on
 * this real invoice resolves — nothing here is a synthetic stand-in.
 *
 * Two figures in this file are empirically measured against the real file
 * with the schema fix from this ticket applied, not copied from
 * PROJECT-SCOPE-v2.md's A5 table:
 *   - The anomaly count. A5 states "3", predating T-30's engine and this
 *     ticket's `express_charges.truck_id` fix — measured here as 84 against
 *     the driver/truck pairing 0004 actually seeds, which its own comment
 *     already flags as "plausible, not verified" against the real fleet
 *     roster. A future correction to that seed data is expected to change
 *     this number; that isn't a regression in this test's own logic.
 *   - Receipt status. A5's "48 of 60 confirmed" reflects a human checking
 *     Samsara/a spreadsheet — external to the CSV. `importInvoice()` never
 *     writes `receipt_checks` (T-35's `POST /receipt-checks` does), so
 *     every stop is `'pending'` immediately after import. The 48/60 figure
 *     belongs to T-33's Overview endpoint, once T-35 exists to produce it.
